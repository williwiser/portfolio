                Hello there, I'm William Wani, a passionate full stack developer
                hailing from the quiet city of Mutare, Zimbabwe. <br />
                I love building web applications and have been diving into
                personal projects for the past two years. I have curated a
                handful of my projects here in my portfolio. <br />
                Right now, I'm pursuing a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Applied
                Mathematics at Rhodes University in South Africa, and I'll be
                graduating in 2025. <br />
                But it's not all code and algorithmsâ€”I'm also a musician, lover
                of jazz and avid stargazer. <br /> Anyways, feel free to take a
                look around and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate or
                just chat!
              </p>
